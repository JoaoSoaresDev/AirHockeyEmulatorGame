# AirHockeyEmulatorGame
Simple Air Hockey game developed using C and OpenGL/freeglut.

This application was developed by me and two other classmates, Michael Stirling and Ricardo Laner (you can find a link to their 
githubs below), for one of our gaming units at university. 

For this game, we made use of model loading and manipulation, 3D matrix manipulation, user interaction and collision detection.

For more about user installation and how to play (controllers), please read the "User Guide" PDF on this project.
